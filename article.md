## Behaviour Driven Development in Swift

### What is BDD?

In software engineering, **behavior-driven development (BDD)** is a software development process that emerged from **test-driven development (TDD).**

#### So what is TDD?

**Test-driven development** is a software development process that relies on the **repetition of** a very **short** development **cycle**: **requirements** are **turned** into very **specific test cases**, then the **software is improved** to **pass** the **new tests, only**. 

#### And back to BDD

**Behavior-driven development** **combines** the general **techniques** and **principles** of **TDD** with **ideas** from **domain-driven design** and **object-oriented analysis** and **design** to provide software development and management teams with **shared tools** and a **shared process** to **collaborate on** software **development**.

#### Why bother?

##### If it's not tested it's not working

##### Story vs. Specification

##### Workflow











### How to approach it?

#### Quick & Nimble

#### Specifications DSL

## Command Line Interfaces in Swift

### What is CLI?

## Swift Package Manager

### What is SPM?

### Why and how to use SPM?

#### Crossplatform

### When not to use SPM?

### Great profits of SPM

#### Generating Xcode project from Swift.package

#### Testing on linux

## Goodies

### Makefile

Here is an image of a test after and before it was fixed to run on linux.
